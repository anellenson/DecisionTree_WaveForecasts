# DecisionTree_WaveForecasts

This is the live demo to accompany the manuscript XX. 

In the manuscript, a bagged regression tree is used to predict wave model error into the future and in one descriptive application to show how the bagged regression tree can be used to find regions of repeated wave model error in wave model phase space. 

In this repo, you'll find a jupyter notebook, an example decision tree, and wave model data. The jupyter notebook is comprised of two parts. The first part shows how to train and test a bagged regression tree. The second shows how to explore the tree architecture to understand how the decision tree partitioned the data and found regions of wave model error.
