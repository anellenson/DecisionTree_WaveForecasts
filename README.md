# DecisionTree_WaveForecasts

This is the live demo to accompany the manuscript XX. 

In the manuscript, a bagged regression tree is used in a predictive and descriptive way. In a predictive sense, it can  estimate wave model error into the future. In a descriptive sense, it can find where there is consistent wave model weakness by partitioning the greatest values of error with respect to wave model phase space. 

In this repo, you'll find a jupyter notebook, an example decision tree, and wave model data. The jupyter notebook is comprised of two parts. The first part shows how to train and test a bagged regression tree. The second shows how to explore the tree architecture to understand how the decision tree partitions the data and finds regions of wave model error.
